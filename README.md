# FreeCodeCamp

List of projects to showcase:
**1) Express with router and a simple form submit behaviour**

In index.js, custom middleswares and built in middleswares are utilised. 
In index.html, a simple form is used to post data and a response is received.
In express router, the concept of CRUD (Create,Read,Update,Delete) is used for routes and enable access to filtered data according to user id. 
The architecture uses MVC (model,view,contoller) to how the project structure is setup. Data is not persisted without a having a proper schema. 

**Tools used**
Nodejs with nodemon module installed for seeing fast effective changes without running same command for code changes.
Postman app is used for testing of APIs.
Putty gen is used to generate SSH key and is stored as SSH login to Github.
Git bash to set branches for commits and pushes codes to repo.
